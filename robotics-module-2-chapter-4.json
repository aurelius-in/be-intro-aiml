                "Coordinate frames are used in robotics to describe the position and orientation of objects in space. Each frame has an origin and three orthogonal axes (x, y, and z) that define its orientation. In robotics, coordinate frames are attached to each link of the robot, as well as to the base and end-effector.",
                "By using coordinate frames, we can describe the pose (position and orientation) of each part of the robot relative to other parts. This is essential for tasks such as controlling the end-effector to reach a desired position, avoiding obstacles, and interacting with objects in the environment."

                "Homogeneous transformation matrices are a common tool used to represent the position and orientation of one coordinate frame relative to another. These matrices combine rotation and translation into a single 4x4 matrix, making it easier to perform successive transformations.",

                "By multiplying transformation matrices, we can convert coordinates from one frame to another. For example, if we have a point P in the coordinate frame A, we can find its coordinates in the frame B by multiplying the transformation matrix from A to B with the coordinates of P in A."

                "The DH convention simplifies the kinematic modeling of robots by reducing the number of parameters needed to describe the transformations. By following a consistent procedure, we can create a kinematic model of the robot that makes it easier to compute forward and inverse kinematics.",

For example, if we have a transformation from frame A to frame B (T_AB) and a transformation from frame B to frame C (T_BC), the transformation from frame A to frame C (T_AC) can be found by multiplying the two matrices:",
