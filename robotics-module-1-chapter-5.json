                "Path planning is a fundamental aspect of robotics, involving the determination of a path or trajectory that a robot should follow to reach a target location from a starting point. It is crucial for enabling robots to navigate through their environments, avoid obstacles, and perform tasks efficiently.",
                "Path planning algorithms can be classified into two main categories: global path planning and local path planning. Global path planning involves generating a complete path based on a known map of the environment, while local path planning involves dynamic adjustments to the path based on real-time sensor data to avoid unexpected obstacles."

            "title": "A* Algorithm",
            "paragraphs": [
                "The A* algorithm is a widely used path planning algorithm that combines the advantages of both Dijkstra's algorithm and the Greedy Best-First-Search algorithm. It finds the shortest path from a starting point to a target point by considering both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to reach the target from that node.",
                "A* uses a heuristic function to estimate the remaining cost to reach the target. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of nodes to be explored, with nodes prioritized based on their total estimated cost. A* is both complete (it will find a path if one exists) and optimal (it will find the shortest path).",
                "The choice of the heuristic function is critical for the performance of the A* algorithm. Common heuristic functions include the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance. The heuristic must be admissible, meaning it should never overestimate the actual cost to reach the target."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) is a path planning algorithm that is particularly effective for high-dimensional spaces and complex environments. RRT builds a tree by randomly sampling points in the space and connecting them to the nearest existing node in the tree, ensuring that the tree rapidly explores the space.",
                "RRT is a probabilistic algorithm, meaning it does not guarantee finding the optimal path, but it can find a feasible path efficiently in high-dimensional spaces. The algorithm is often used for robotic motion planning, especially in environments with many obstacles or constraints.",
                "The basic steps of the RRT algorithm include sampling a random point in the space, finding the nearest node in the tree, and extending the tree towards the sampled point. This process continues until the tree reaches the target or the maximum number of iterations is reached."

                "Hybrid path planning algorithms combine elements of both global and local planning to achieve robust and efficient navigation. These algorithms use a global planner to generate a high-level path and a local planner to make real-time adjustments based on sensor data.",
                "For example, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) is a hybrid algorithm that combines global path planning with local obstacle avoidance. The global planner generates a rough path to the target, while the local planner uses real-time sensor data to navigate around obstacles and refine the path.",
                "Hybrid algorithms are particularly useful for robots operating in dynamic environments where obstacles and conditions can change rapidly. They provide a balance between optimal path planning and real-time adaptability."
