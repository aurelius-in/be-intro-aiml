            "paragraphs": [
                "Teleoperation involves the remote control of a robot by a human operator. The operator sends commands to the robot and receives feedback from the robot's sensors, enabling real-time control and monitoring.",
                "Teleoperation is commonly used in applications where direct human presence is impractical or dangerous, such as space exploration, underwater missions, and hazardous material handling. It allows humans to perform tasks in environments that are otherwise inaccessible or unsafe.",
                "Key features of teleoperation include real-time communication, precise control, and the ability to perform complex tasks remotely. Challenges include latency, bandwidth limitations, and the need for skilled operators.",
                "Advanced teleoperation systems often include haptic feedback, allowing operators to feel what the robot is touching, enhancing precision and control. This is particularly important in delicate tasks such as surgery and bomb disposal.",
                "Future developments in teleoperation aim to reduce latency, improve bandwidth, and enhance the realism of remote environments through augmented and virtual reality technologies."

            "paragraphs": [
                "In supervisory control, the human operator provides high-level commands to the robot, which then executes the tasks autonomously. The operator monitors the robot's performance and intervenes only when necessary.",
                "This interaction type is used in applications such as industrial automation, military operations, and autonomous vehicles. It allows operators to manage multiple robots or systems simultaneously, improving efficiency and reducing workload.",
                "Key features of supervisory control include autonomy, the ability to handle complex tasks, and reduced operator workload. Challenges include ensuring reliable autonomy, maintaining situational awareness, and handling unexpected situations.",
                "Supervisory control systems often incorporate advanced monitoring and diagnostic tools to help operators maintain awareness of the robot's status and performance. These tools can include real-time data visualization, alerts, and predictive maintenance features.",
                "As robots become more autonomous, the role of human supervisors will evolve to focus more on oversight and exception handling rather than direct control. This shift requires new skills and training for human operators."

                "Collaborative control involves humans and robots working together to complete tasks, with each contributing their strengths. Collaborative robots (cobots) are designed to assist humans in tasks such as assembly, packaging, and healthcare.",
                "Cobots are equipped with sensors and safety features that allow them to operate safely alongside humans. They can learn from human demonstrations, adapt to changing environments, and provide assistance in a flexible and intuitive manner.",
                "Key features of collaborative control include safety, adaptability, and ease of use. Challenges include ensuring safe interactions, developing intuitive interfaces, and achieving effective collaboration.",
                "Collaborative control systems often include shared control schemes where the robot and human share control of the task. This can involve the robot assisting with repetitive or physically demanding parts of the task while the human handles complex decision-making.",
                "The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in cobots enables them to learn from human partners and improve their performance over time. This learning can be used to enhance safety, efficiency, and the quality of the collaborative process."
