            "paragraphs": [
                "Teleoperation involves the remote control of a robot by a human operator. The operator sends commands to the robot and receives feedback from the robot's sensors, enabling real-time control and monitoring.",
                "Teleoperation is commonly used in applications where direct human presence is impractical or dangerous, such as space exploration, underwater missions, and hazardous material handling. It allows humans to perform tasks in environments that are otherwise inaccessible or unsafe.",
                "Key features of teleoperation include real-time communication, precise control, and the ability to perform complex tasks remotely. Challenges include latency, bandwidth limitations, and the need for skilled operators."

                "In supervisory control, the human operator provides high-level commands to the robot, which then executes the tasks autonomously. The operator monitors the robot's performance and intervenes only when necessary.",
                "This interaction type is used in applications such as industrial automation, military operations, and autonomous vehicles. It allows operators to manage multiple robots or systems simultaneously, improving efficiency and reducing workload.",
                "Key features of supervisory control include autonomy, the ability to handle complex tasks, and reduced operator workload. Challenges include ensuring reliable autonomy, maintaining situational awareness, and handling unexpected situations."

                "Social robots are designed to recognize and respond to human emotions, gestures, and speech. They can provide companionship, assist with daily tasks, and enhance learning experiences.",
                "Key features of social interaction include natural communication, emotional intelligence, and user engagement. Challenges include developing accurate emotion recognition, ensuring ethical behavior, and creating meaningful interactions."

                "Ensuring ethical behavior and respecting user privacy are important considerations in human-robot interaction. Key ethical and privacy issues include:",
                "1. **Privacy**: Robots must handle user data responsibly, ensuring that personal information is protected and used appropriately. This includes implementing data encryption, access controls, and transparent data handling practices.",
                "2. **Autonomy and Control**: Balancing robot autonomy with human control is essential to ensure that humans can intervene when necessary. This includes providing clear interfaces for human control and ensuring that robots do not override human decisions.",
                "3. **Bias and Fairness**: Avoiding biases in robot behavior is important to ensure fair treatment of all users. This includes developing unbiased algorithms, testing for bias, and ensuring that robots do not perpetuate or amplify existing biases.",
                "4. **Accountability**: Ensuring that there is clear accountability for the actions of robots is important, particularly in critical applications such as healthcare and law enforcement. This includes establishing clear lines of responsibility and ensuring that robots operate within legal and ethical guidelines."
