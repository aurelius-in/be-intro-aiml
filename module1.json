          "heading": "History of AI",
          "content": "The concept of AI has roots in ancient history, where myths and stories featured intelligent robots and artificial beings. Modern AI began to take shape in the mid-20th century with the development of computers and the formalization of the field of AI in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference. Early AI research focused on symbolic methods and problem-solving techniques. Over the decades, the field has evolved through various phases, including the rise of machine learning and the current era of deep learning, powered by neural networks and large datasets."
