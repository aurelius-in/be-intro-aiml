                "Electric motors are widely used in robotics due to their versatility and ease of control. They can be found in applications ranging from driving wheels and joints to operating grippers and other end-effectors. Servos are specialized motors that provide precise control over angular or linear position, making them ideal for tasks requiring accuracy.",
                "Pneumatic and hydraulic actuators are used in applications where high force or rapid motion is required. These actuators use compressed air or fluid to generate movement and are often found in industrial robots and heavy machinery.",
                "Linear actuators convert rotational motion into linear motion, which is useful for tasks such as lifting, pushing, or pulling objects. They are commonly used in robotic arms and other mechanisms that require linear movement.",
                "The choice of actuators depends on the specific requirements of the robotic system, including the type of motion needed, the amount of force required, and the operating environment. For example, underwater robots often use hydraulic actuators due to their resistance to water ingress and ability to generate high force."
