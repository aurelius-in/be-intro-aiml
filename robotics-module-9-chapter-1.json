                "Swarm robotics is inspired by the collective behavior of social insects, such as ants, bees, and termites. These insects work together to achieve complex tasks through simple local interactions and decentralized control.",
                "In swarm robotics, multiple robots operate together to perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of a single robot. The collective behavior of the swarm emerges from the interactions between individual robots and their environment."

                "Swarm robotics exhibits several key characteristics, including:",
                "1. **Decentralized Control**: There is no central controller coordinating the robots. Instead, each robot makes decisions based on local information and interactions with neighboring robots.",
                "2. **Scalability**: Swarm systems can scale to large numbers of robots, with the collective behavior remaining robust and effective.",
                "3. **Robustness**: The failure of individual robots does not significantly impact the overall performance of the swarm. The system is resilient to robot failures and environmental changes.",
                "4. **Emergent Behavior**: Complex behaviors emerge from the simple rules followed by individual robots. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but result from the interactions within the swarm."

                "1. **Flocking**: Inspired by the behavior of birds, flocking involves robots moving together in a cohesive group while avoiding collisions and aligning their direction.",
                "2. **Foraging**: Inspired by the behavior of ants, foraging involves robots searching for and collecting resources, then returning them to a designated location.",
                "3. **Aggregation**: Inspired by the behavior of social insects, aggregation involves robots clustering together in specific areas to achieve a collective task.",
                "4. **Dispersion**: Inspired by the behavior of territorial animals, dispersion involves robots spreading out evenly across an environment to maximize coverage and minimize interference."
