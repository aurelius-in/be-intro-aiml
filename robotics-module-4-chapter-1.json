                "Sensing and perception are fundamental components of robotic systems that enable robots to interact with and understand their environment. Sensing refers to the detection of physical phenomena such as light, sound, heat, and pressure, while perception involves interpreting and making sense of this sensor data.",
                "Effective sensing and perception are essential for tasks such as navigation, object recognition, and manipulation. They allow robots to perform complex tasks autonomously and safely by providing the necessary information about the environment and the robot's own state.",
                "Sensing and perception involve a combination of hardware and software components. Sensors collect data from the environment, while perception algorithms process this data to extract meaningful information. This information is then used by the robot's control system to make decisions and perform actions.",
