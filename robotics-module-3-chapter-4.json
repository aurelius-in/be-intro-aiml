                "Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is one of the most commonly used control strategies in robotics. It combines three types of control actions: proportional, integral, and derivative, each addressing different aspects of system performance.",
                "Proportional control (P) provides a control output that is proportional to the error, which is the difference between the desired setpoint and the measured process variable. This type of control helps reduce the magnitude of the error.",
                "Integral control (I) accumulates the error over time and provides a control output based on the total accumulated error. This helps eliminate steady-state error and ensures the system reaches the desired setpoint.",
                "Derivative control (D) provides a control output based on the rate of change of the error. This helps predict future error and improves the stability and responsiveness of the system.",

Another technique is adaptive gain scheduling, where the controller parameters are adjusted based on the operating conditions.",

It then optimizes the control inputs to minimize a cost function while satisfying constraints. The first control input is applied, and the process is repeated at the next control step.",
