            "paragraphs": [
                "Several key ethical issues arise in the field of robotics, including:",
                "1. **Privacy**: Robots often collect and process personal data, raising concerns about data security and privacy. Ensuring that user data is protected and used responsibly is crucial for maintaining trust.",
                "2. **Autonomy**: The level of autonomy granted to robots raises questions about control and oversight. Balancing robot autonomy with human control is important to ensure safety and prevent misuse.",
                "3. **Accountability**: Determining who is accountable for the actions of robots, particularly in cases of harm or malfunction, is a complex ethical issue. Clear lines of responsibility must be established to address this challenge.",
                "4. **Bias and Fairness**: The potential for bias in robotic systems, whether due to data, algorithms, or design, raises concerns about fairness and equality. Ensuring that robots do not perpetuate or amplify existing biases is essential.",
                "5. **Impact on Employment**: The deployment of robots can impact employment and job markets, raising ethical questions about the displacement of human workers and the need for workforce adaptation.",
                "6. **Safety**: Ensuring that robots operate safely in human environments is paramount. This includes physical safety to prevent harm and operational safety to ensure reliable performance.",
                "7. **Transparency**: The decision-making processes of robots should be transparent and understandable to humans. This helps build trust and allows for better oversight and accountability."

                "1. **Beneficence**: Promoting the well-being and benefit of individuals and society. Robots should be designed and used to enhance quality of life and address societal needs.",
                "2. **Non-Maleficence**: Avoiding harm to individuals and society. Robots should be designed and used to minimize risks and prevent negative consequences.",
                "3. **Autonomy**: Respecting the autonomy and decision-making capabilities of individuals. Robots should support and enhance human autonomy, rather than undermine it.",
                "4. **Justice**: Ensuring fairness and equality in the design and use of robots. This includes addressing potential biases and ensuring equitable access to robotic technology.",
                "5. **Accountability**: Establishing clear lines of responsibility for the actions of robots. This includes ensuring that designers, developers, and users are accountable for the ethical implications of their work.",
                "Ethical frameworks, such as the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems and the European Commission's Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, provide comprehensive guidelines for ethical robotics. These frameworks emphasize principles such as transparency, accountability, and inclusivity."
