                "Several key ethical issues arise in the field of robotics, including:",
                "1. **Privacy**: Robots often collect and process personal data, raising concerns about data security and privacy. Ensuring that user data is protected and used responsibly is crucial for maintaining trust.",
                "2. **Autonomy**: The level of autonomy granted to robots raises questions about control and oversight. Balancing robot autonomy with human control is important to ensure safety and prevent misuse.",
                "3. **Accountability**: Determining who is accountable for the actions of robots, particularly in cases of harm or malfunction, is a complex ethical issue. Clear lines of responsibility must be established to address this challenge.",
                "4. **Bias and Fairness**: The potential for bias in robotic systems, whether due to data, algorithms, or design, raises concerns about fairness and equality. Ensuring that robots do not perpetuate or amplify existing biases is essential.",
                "5. **Impact on Employment**: The deployment of robots can impact employment and job markets, raising ethical questions about the displacement of human workers and the need for workforce adaptation."
