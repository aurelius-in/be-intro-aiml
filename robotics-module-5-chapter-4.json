                "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agent aims to maximize its cumulative reward over time.",
                "In reinforcement learning, the agent takes actions in an environment to achieve a goal. Each action results in a new state and a reward, and the agent learns to associate actions with rewards to develop an optimal policy for decision-making."

                "1. **Agent**: The entity that makes decisions and interacts with the environment.",
                "2. **Environment**: The external system with which the agent interacts. The environment provides states, rewards, and transitions based on the agent's actions.",
                "3. **State**: A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment.",
                "4. **Action**: A decision made by the agent that affects the state of the environment.",
                "5. **Reward**: A scalar value provided by the environment to indicate the success or failure of an action. The agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward.",
                "6. **Policy**: A strategy that defines the agent's behavior, mapping states to actions.",
