                "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agent aims to maximize its cumulative reward over time.",
                "In reinforcement learning, the agent takes actions in an environment to achieve a goal. Each action results in a new state and a reward, and the agent learns to associate actions with rewards to develop an optimal policy for decision-making.",
                "Unlike supervised learning, where the model learns from a dataset of input-output pairs, reinforcement learning involves learning from the consequences of actions taken. This allows the agent to learn strategies that lead to long-term success, rather than just immediate rewards.",
                "Reinforcement learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where learning is driven by the outcomes of actions. The agent's goal is to discover which actions yield the most reward over time, balancing the trade-off between exploring new actions and exploiting known ones."

                "3. **State**: A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment.",
                "4. **Action**: A decision made by the agent that affects the state of the environment.",
                "5. **Reward**: A scalar value provided by the environment to indicate the success or failure of an action. The agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward.",
                "6. **Policy**: A strategy that defines the agent's behavior, mapping states to actions.",
