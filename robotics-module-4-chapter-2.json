            "paragraphs": [
                "Ultrasonic sensors are used for distance measurement and obstacle avoidance. They emit sound waves at a frequency higher than the human audible range and measure the time it takes for the echo to return. This time-of-flight measurement allows the sensor to calculate the distance to an object.",
                "Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used in mobile robots for obstacle detection and navigation. They are relatively inexpensive and can work in various lighting conditions. However, their accuracy can be affected by the shape and material of the target object.",
                "These sensors are particularly effective in detecting large, flat surfaces but may struggle with small or irregularly shaped objects. Ultrasonic sensors can also be used underwater, making them suitable for certain marine applications."

                "Infrared (IR) sensors are used for object detection and proximity sensing. They emit infrared light and measure the reflection from nearby objects. The intensity of the reflected light is used to determine the distance to the object.",
                "IR sensors are often used in line-following robots and for short-range obstacle detection. They are affordable and easy to use but can be affected by ambient light and reflective surfaces.",
                "One limitation of IR sensors is that they can be less effective in detecting objects that do not reflect infrared light well, such as certain dark or transparent materials. They are commonly used in combination with other sensors to improve reliability."

RGB cameras capture color images, depth cameras provide distance information for each pixel, and stereo cameras use two lenses to create a 3D representation of the environment.",

They provide real-time data on the robot's orientation and motion but can suffer from drift over time, requiring calibration and sensor fusion techniques to improve accuracy.",
