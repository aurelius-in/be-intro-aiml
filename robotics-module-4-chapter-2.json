                "Ultrasonic sensors are used for distance measurement and obstacle avoidance. They emit sound waves at a frequency higher than the human audible range and measure the time it takes for the echo to return. This time-of-flight measurement allows the sensor to calculate the distance to an object.",
                "Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used in mobile robots for obstacle detection and navigation. They are relatively inexpensive and can work in various lighting conditions. However, their accuracy can be affected by the shape and material of the target object."

                "Infrared (IR) sensors are used for object detection and proximity sensing. They emit infrared light and measure the reflection from nearby objects. The intensity of the reflected light is used to determine the distance to the object.",
                "IR sensors are often used in line-following robots and for short-range obstacle detection. They are affordable and easy to use but can be affected by ambient light and reflective surfaces."

                "There are different types of cameras used in robotics, including RGB cameras, depth cameras, and stereo cameras. RGB cameras capture color images, depth cameras provide distance information for each pixel, and stereo cameras use two lenses to create a 3D representation of the environment.",

                "LIDAR is commonly used in autonomous vehicles for navigation and obstacle detection. It provides high-resolution 3D maps and can work in various lighting conditions. However, LIDAR sensors are relatively expensive and can be affected by weather conditions such as rain and fog."

                "IMUs are essential for applications that require precise tracking of the robot's movements, such as aerial drones, mobile robots, and humanoid robots. They provide real-time data on the robot's orientation and motion but can suffer from drift over time, requiring calibration and sensor fusion techniques to improve accuracy."

                "These sensors are typically placed at the robot's joints or end-effectors to provide feedback on the forces experienced during tasks. They enable the robot to adjust its movements to avoid damaging objects or itself.",
                "Force/torque sensors are crucial for applications that involve delicate handling or collaborative tasks with humans. They provide valuable feedback for ensuring safety and precision but can be expensive and require careful integration into the robot's control system."
