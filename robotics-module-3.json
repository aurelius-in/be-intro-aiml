                "The Newton-Euler formulation is a popular method for deriving the equations of motion for robotic systems. It combines Newton's second law of motion, which relates force and acceleration, with Euler's equations, which relate torque and angular acceleration.",
                "Newton-Euler dynamics involves two main steps: forward recursion and backward recursion. In the forward recursion, the kinematic quantities such as velocities and accelerations are calculated for each link, starting from the base and moving towards the end-effector. In the backward recursion, the dynamic quantities such as forces and torques are calculated, starting from the end-effector and moving towards the base.",
                "This method provides a systematic approach for deriving the dynamic equations of serial manipulators, allowing for the calculation of joint torques required to achieve a desired motion. The Newton-Euler formulation is efficient and can be applied to robots with multiple degrees of freedom."

                "The Lagrangian of a system is defined as the difference between its kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V): L = T - V. The equations of motion are derived by applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the Lagrangian.",
                "Lagrangian dynamics provides a powerful and elegant approach for analyzing the dynamics of robotic systems. It is particularly useful for systems with complex constraints and for robots with non-linear dynamics. The Lagrangian formulation can be extended to include generalized coordinates and can handle both holonomic and non-holonomic constraints."
